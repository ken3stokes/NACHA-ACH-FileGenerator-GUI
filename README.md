# NACHA-ACH-FileGenerator-GUI

## Fictional ACH File Generator

This simple GUI application allows users to generate a fictional ACH file for testing purposes. The application was built using Python's `tkinter` library and provides a "Generate ACH File" button that, when clicked, creates a fictional ACH file named in the format `fictional_ach_file_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`.

## Features:

1. Generates fictional ACH files based on random fictional data.
2. Every generated file has a unique filename based on the current date and time.
3. Simple GUI for easy use.

## Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python (3.x recommended) installed.

## Usage:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the ACH generator script.
3. Run the script to launch the GUI.
4. Click the "Generate ACH File" button to create a new fictional ACH file.

## Example:

Upon clicking the button, you might get a file like `fictional_ach_file_20230814_142545.txt` depending on the current date and time.

## Note:

This is purely fictional data meant for testing and demonstration purposes. Do not use it for commercial or real-world applications.
